# Arbitrary Martingale Betting System
![MBS Intro](https://www.linkpicture.com/q/3Martingale-betting-system.png)

## Summary
Arbitary Martingale Betting System is an algorithm that transforms betting options from discrete fixed rules into almost continous ranges that fully tailers your own needs. In a short word, it allows you to make the Rules yourself. With AMBS, Cascino can become you second place for investment. In this ReadMe, I will walk you through the history of Martingale, my inspirations, the adaptations applied, and applications along with mathematical proofs and other discussions. 

## History of Martingale Betting System
A martingale is any of a class of betting strategies that originated from and were popular in 18th-century France. The simplest of these strategies was designed for a game in which the gambler wins the stake if a coin comes up heads and loses it if the coin comes up tails. The strategy had the gambler double the bet after every loss, so that the first win would recover all previous losses plus win a profit equal to the original stake. The martingale strategy has been applied to roulette as well, as the probability of hitting either red or black is close to 50%.

Since a gambler with infinite wealth will, almost surely, eventually flip heads, the martingale betting strategy was seen as a sure thing by those who advocated it. None of the gamblers possessed infinite wealth, and the exponential growth of the bets would eventually bankrupt "unlucky" gamblers who chose to use the martingale. The gambler usually wins a small net reward, thus appearing to have a sound strategy. However, the gambler's expected value does indeed remain zero (or less than zero) because the small probability that the gambler will suffer a catastrophic loss exactly balances with the expected gain. In a casino, the expected value is negative, due to the house's edge. The likelihood of catastrophic loss may not even be very small. The bet size rises exponentially. This, combined with the fact that strings of consecutive losses actually occur more often than common intuition suggests, can bankrupt a gambler quickly. (From WikiPedia)

#### Comments:
Traditional MBS, is indeed, as simple as above. The description above captrues the two significant features of MBS:
1. **Its Ideology** "Double you bet everytime you lose" is indeed a good way to put it, but it's far from accurate. In the case where the odd is 1:1, coin flips for instance, your action is indeed: Double your next bet. Since then if you win, you will win all your 'sink costs' back plus your initial bet. This **Ideology** is essential of MBS, and actually extends to all senarious which I will discuss in the following paragraphs: **Bet an amount such that, if you win, you would win all your 'sink costs' back plus your the amount of reward if you win the first time.** 
2. **Infinite Wealth** Traditional MBS is often believed to be unpractical due to the shared belief that "One need to have infinite wealth to gurantee that MBS will eventually work". This belif, I assume come from the experiences of the players from 18th century who have little to none grasp of probability theory. Although the WikiPedia description about how the "Bet" grows expoentially and it's possible that someone is very unlucky and keep losing straight up are **Both True**, infitie wealth is **NOT Necessay**. In the traditional approch, MBS is like the following: WHILE you have not win for once, keep adding your bet so that *"if you win, you would win all your 'sink costs' back plus your the amount of reward if you win the first time."* However, an adaptation can be made: observing the stake (amount of investment) you wish to spend, and divide the stake in a way it supports **n** consecutive failures. I will explain this in full detail in the upcoming sections.

## Inspiration
I remember it was the first year as a Math major and I took my first programing course (Matlab was the first program language I learned). It so happended that I was taking a Math class about Finance, Arbitarge and sutff plus a intro level of statistics. Back then, I did NOT know anything about MBS, do not know that it exist, but an interesting (at least for me) thought experiment captured my attention for almost an entire afternoon:"If you roll a dice, there is a 1/6 chance that you will get '1', then how many times you need to roll to "guarantee" that you get at least one '1'?"  Before I take the stats course, I would probability answer 6, as it appears to be the only number in the question and it sort of 'make sense'. That, is completly errouns however. In fact, to be 99% certain that you will get at least one 6, you will need to roll 25.259 times!!! Since I have derived the formula for **n** as the number of times to roll, to archive **cp**(cumulative probability) at **p**: n(p,cp) = <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\frac{ln(1-cp)}{ln(1-p)}"> (For proof details see *Appendix_A_1*). 

Now with this powerful tool (formulat) added towards our tool box, we have aquired the key towards a **Finite Wealth** based MBS system. Just name the probability you want to achive, and this formula will output the number of time you need to play to acheive such probability. Here is how this works: Assume there is this game where if you flip a coin and get 'head', the odd is 1:1, such that whatever the amount you pay, you get it bet back. Now, assume you want at least 96% of confidence that you win at least once, how many time do you need to bet?  Just plug in CP = 0.96 and P = 0.5 into our formula, and whola! You get n = 4.64, so you need to bet at least 5 times to have a **96%** cumulative probability (or confidence) that you can win at least once. And this setting, sounds so familiar right? In the premise of MBS, as long as you can win once before you broke, you **WIN all your sink costs PLUS your first Reward!** So now, say you want to win $10, how much do you need to prepare to play 5 times? You would need $310 to do that. (I have worked out the formular for you: **Money_need = Bet * (2^n - 1)**, check *Appendix_A_2* for proof details.) 

Next, let's change the way the Question is Asked: If you have $310, and you want to be 96% CONFIDENT, how much should you bet in the first bet? Now you know it's $10 from previous example. But what if you want to be only 80% confident, what then??? 

Simple! Let's check our tool box: **Money_need = Bet * (2^n - 1) , n = ln(1-cp)/ln(1-p)"** now if we 'do a little algebra' Bet with Money_need (Since it's fixed now), we will have the formula that gives our first Bet: **Bet = Money_needed / (2^(ln(1-cp)/ln(1-p)) - 1)** And if we plug in all the coefs, we get: Bet = $62! Then you know what to do next, simple: double your last bet untill the 5th (ln(1-0.8)/ln(1-0.5)) time. 

So that's it! You do not need to be infinitly wealthy to take advantage of the MBS scheme! Just need to do some math and forge a plan! But now comes the question...Can you extend to arbitray senario where the pay off is Not 1:1? Certainly, and that's why it's called **ARBITRAY** Martingale Betting System since whatever the rules, just plug in the numbers and the Formula Looks like this:

Which is Almost Identical to what we've got now! And the Proof is absolutly Neat. If you wish to see the entire derivation of this essential formula, please do not hesitate to go Directly to 【Appendix_A】. I will meet you there!
